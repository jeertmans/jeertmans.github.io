# Welcome to the repo of my personal blog!

The code used to generate my website is fully contained in the public repository, more specifically using the [github-pages.yml](https://github.com/jeertmans/jeertmans.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/github-pages.yml) action.

# You want to have a similar blog?

This repository started by using the [minimal mistakes starter template](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter), which I recommend to use if you are looking for a basic blog.

Thereon, I also implemented many [features](https://eertmans.be/tags/#miscellaneous) to better suit my needs. If you would like to have a blog very similar to mine, do not hesitate to [fork](https://github.com/jeertmans/jeertmans.github.io/fork) this repo.

If you have any question or suggestion, please feel free to reach me via the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jeertmans/jeertmans.github.io/issues) or via [email](mailto:jerome@eertmans.be).
