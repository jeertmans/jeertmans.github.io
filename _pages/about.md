Hello, I am JÃ©rome and welcome to my personal blog!

I am a PhD student working at UCLouvain as a Teaching Assistant, under the supervision of [Pr. Claude Oestges](https://uclouvain.be/en/directories/Claude.Oestges) and [Pr. Laurent Jacques](https://uclouvain.be/en/directories/laurent.jacques). I work within COmmunication SYstems (COSY) group and my research topic is *Differentiable Ray Tracing for Telecommunications*.

Beside my academical research, I really like to develop open source softwares. While most of my projects stay under the radar, some received more attention, such as [ADE Scheduler](https://github.com/ADE-Scheduler/ADE-Scheduler), a scheduling tool used by thousands of people at my university.

On this blog, you will find posts on topcis related to my research, but also on side projects or things that I think are work talking about.

If you have any question, do not hesitate to reach me!
