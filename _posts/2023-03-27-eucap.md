EuCAP 2023 presentation slides and code.

<!--more-->

On Monday, March 27, 2023, I presented my work {% cite Eert2303:Min %} at the
17th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2023).
The work was pretty similar to the one presented at the
[COST meeting](/posts/cost-interact-june-2022-presentation/) last year, in Lyon,
and contains very minimal changes in the contents.

Slides, however, were modified to contain more details about the mathematics
behind our methods, as well as an example application to meta-surfaces. For this
presentation, I developed [Manim Slides](https://github.com/jeertmans/manim-slides), a successor of the
[manim-presentation Python library](https://github.com/galatolofederico/manim-presentation). For more
details, feel free to take a look at the [project page](/projects/manim-slides).
