Presentation slides and code for my talk in Siegen, Germany.

<!--more-->

On Jul 17th 2023, I have been invited to visit Pr. Andreas Kolb's lab and give a small talk
about my current research in the field of Ray Tracing applied to Telecommunictions. Indeed,
Mohamed Saleh, one of his researchers, is working on applying Ray Tracing techniques at
Terahertz frequencies to detect defects in carbon fibers.

I am very much grateful to Pr. Andreas Kolb and his team for the invitation!

The slides are a modified version from those I presented at EuCAP2023, plus
some insights about my ongoing work.
