PhD confirmation test slides.

<!--more-->

As part of my PhD, I had to pass a confirmation test which consists
in a relatively long oral presentation of my work and technical questions
from my thesis committee.

Below are my slides. Most slides contain notes,
which you can read by pressing <kbd>S</kbd>.
