Our paper has been accepted to EuCAP 2024!

<!--more-->

At EuCAP 2024, I presented our paper
*Fully Differentiable Ray Tracing via Discontinuity Smoothing for Radio Network Optimization*
{% cite Eert2403:Fully %}.
In this work, we investigate the challenges of making a
Fully Differentiable Ray Tracing software
for radio propagation applications.
