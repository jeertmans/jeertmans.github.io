Presentation slides and code for my talk in Milan, Italy.

<!--more-->

As part of my Short Term Scientific Mission (STSM)
to Pr. Vittorio Degli Esposti's lab in UniBo,
I made a stopover in Milan. Below you can find my slides,
*made during the train journey by combining
previous presentations*,
as well as the code to reproduce them locally.

I am very much grateful to Nicola Di Cicco for inviting me for a small talk
(in the hope
to start new collaborations),
as well as the COST Interact action for funding this STSM!
