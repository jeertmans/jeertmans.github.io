Presentation of the in-progress work between UCLouvain and UniBo.

<!--more-->

During a short-term scientific mission in Cesena where I visited Professors Vittorio Degli-Esposti and Enrico Maria Vitucci's laboratory, we started a collaboration on the topic of Machine Learning applied to Ray Tracing, with the aim to accelerate it.

Below, you can find slides presenting our preliminary results at the COST INTERACT meeting in Helsinki, June 2024.
