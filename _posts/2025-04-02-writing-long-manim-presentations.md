Sharing my setup and tips for writing long Manim (Slides) presentations!

<!--more-->

Recently, I finished another Manim Slides presentation and I feel
that my experience of writing slides using Manim becomes more and more smoother.

However, this hasn't been always an easy process, especially in my early days
of using Manim. Moreover, Manim Slides, the tool I developped to generate
slides from Manim videos, has evolved quite a lot since 2023, and now offers
much more options for rapid development of slides than it did in its first versions.

When reading the Manim subreddit and discord group, I often see people
asking for tips to reduce the time for rendering animations.

This blog post is about sharing my experience with rendering Manim animations,
and my tips to make your experience as smooth as possible, in order to minimize
the time you spend waiting for your slides to render.

I have split this in multiple sections, each addressing one important aspect to
take into account when using Manim. The last section will give tips about those
preparing slides specifically.

## Environment setup

Preparing slides is usually an iterative process, and it mights takes multiple iterations before you are happy with them.
This post focuses on setting up the good habits to make this iterative process as smooth as possible, and it starts with your
development environment.

First, please create a virtual environment and clearly indicate the exact dependencies in a file like `pyproject.toml`{: .filepath} (or the old `requirements.txt`{: .filepath}). Manim usually contains breaking changes between versions, and so does other packages, so I recommend using strict dependency specifier, e.g., `manim==0.19` instead of just `manim`. E.g., it could look something like this:

```toml
[dependency-groups]
dev = [
  # We want the Qt GUI for debugging our presentations
  "manim-slides[manim,pyside6]==5.5.1",
]

[project]
dependencies = [
  "choreographer<1",
  "kaleido==0.2.1",
  # ManimCE's version is automatically defined from Manim Slides' extra
  "manim-slides[manim]==5.5.1",
  "pandas>=2.2.3",
  "pillow>=11.1.0",
  "plotly>=5.24.1,<6",
  "scipy>=1.15.1",
]
description = "Add your description here"
name = "name-of-your-presentation"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
version = "0.1.0"
```
{: file="pyproject.toml" }

### Using Git (or any VCS)

This is probably not required, but I highly recommend any person making presentations,
and this is not limited to Manim users, but also applies any compiled document (LaTeX, Typst, Markdown, etc.),
to use a version-control system (VCS) like Git.

You will make errors, you will want to revert changes, and what is better than a tool
that allows you to track the history of changes and help you go back in the past to retrieve code
that was previously working?

 I will not motivate nor explain 

Maybe, multiple days will pass between two iterations, and 

First of all, when prepar

### Formatting and linting your code

Writing long presentations often means long code. Manim isn't the best package
when it comes to good coding practice (the `from manim import *` is one of the best example of things ),
so your code will probably not look very clean (and so does my code), but it is always nice to use tools
that format or lint your code to help you write more readable code. This is purely esthetic, but it will likely help you debug your code later.

Again, it won't go into details here and
