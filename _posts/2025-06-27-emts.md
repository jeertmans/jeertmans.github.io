Prof. Enrico Maria Vitucci presented our work at 2025 URSI EMTS!

<!--more-->

As I could not be physically present for the 2025 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Theory, Prof. Enrico Maria Vitucci presented our work on *generative path selection* for efficient Ray Tracing. The presentation contents and slides are very close to what I presented at the [INTERACT COST meeting in Dublin, in January 2025](./posts). For more details on the model we used, check out the [ICMLCN 2025 post](/posts/icmlcn2025-presentation).
