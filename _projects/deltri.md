Divide and conquer Delaunay triangulation in C.

<!--more-->

The following code provides a fast implementation of the 2D Delaunay
Triangulation using the divide and conquer approach.

# Story

During my second year of Master, at UCLouvain, I followed the
*Numerical Geometry (LMECA2170)* class, given by Professors
Vincent Legat and Jean-Fran√ßois Remacle.

At the end of the semester, we were challenged to, in groups of 1 or 2 students,
implement one of the algorithms taught in the class, in an efficient and
*beautiful*[^1] manner.

Because I really enjoyed this project, I went a bit further and created a nice
user interface with sounds[^2]. The code is fully
[open source](https://github.com/jeertmans/DelaunayTriangulation)
and should very run
in a few commands.

Finally, I made a
[YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK2PsMuicSN8PIRBZCy7sXEtvngdwV6UH)
for those who just want to see the code in action, without compiling it locally.


[^1]: A 2D graphic library was provided and creating a nice user interface was a bonus.

[^2]: I really recommend you to try the *YOUPIDOU* mode!
