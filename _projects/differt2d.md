2D Toolbox for Differentiable Ray Tracing.

<!--more-->

DiffeRT2d is a Python proof-of-concept module developed for the scientific paper
*Fully Differentiable Ray Tracing via Discontinuity Smoothing for Radio Network Optimization*,
submitted and accepted at EuCAP 2024, Glasgow, Scotland.

This module offers an easy to use API to create basic 2D scenarios, and should
only be used for educational purpose, e.g., to teach Ray Tracing.

It does not include any radio propagation utility. For more advanced use-cases and
real applications, see our main project, [DiffeRT](/projects/differt).

Please refer to the online documentation or repository (links above) for nice
examples and install guidelines.
