Find files matching patterns while respecting `.gitignore`.

<!--more-->

[FilesFinder](https://github.com/jeertmans/filesfinder) (FF) is faster
alternative to `find` for searching files based on patterns (globs or regexes)
while respecting ignore files.

This project was mainly developed as a way to learn Rust threads
and how to create a GitHub action.
