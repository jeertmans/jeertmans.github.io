Tool for live presentations using manim.

<!--more-->

Manim Slides is an extension to Manim that allows to create nice presentations
from already existing Manim animations[^1], with minimal changes required.

# Story

During May ~ June 2022, I discovered [manim-presentation](https://github.com/galatolofederico/manim-presentation),
a tool that allows to present Manim animations in a *PowerPoint-like* manner.
Very rapidly, I decided to use this tool to create my presentation for
the COST Interact 2022 meeting
(see [blog post](/posts/cost-interact-presentation/)).

This first experience was great, but I felt like some important features were missing,
 like support for ManimGL.
As the main GitHub repository was relatively inactive, in September 2022,
I decided to fork it and work on my own project.

Since, the initial codebase has completely changed, and this project has evolved
a lot. If you are interested, I highly recommend you to check it out!

[^1]: Manim is a video engine that makes creating math animations super easy! For more details, see my [Manim tutorial](/projects/manim-tutorial/).
