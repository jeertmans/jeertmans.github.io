Manim tutorial presented to PhD and Master student at UCLouvain.

<!--more-->

On October 18th, I presented for the UCLouvain IEEE Student Branch a tutorial about Manim and its tools.

Manim is a powerful animation engine that allows to create math animations easily, through basic Python scripts. We present Manim as a nice tool to use for any kind of people willing to present math-related contents.

This tutorial is available [online](https://eertmans.be/manim-tutorial) with its slides, and is fully [open source](https://github.com/jeertmans/manim-tutorial). A recording is also available on YouTube (see below).
