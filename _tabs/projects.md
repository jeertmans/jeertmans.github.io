I love programming, and I love the philosophy of open sourcing content!

As a result, I am quite active on GitHub (and other platforms) on which
I publish open source contents, for my own use but also **for the community**.

You can find a comprehensive list of my contributions to (external) open source projects
[here](https://github.com/search?q=author%3Ajeertmans+is%3Amerged+-org%3Ajeertmans+-org%3ALELEC210X+-org%3AUCLOUVAIN-CLUB-ELEC+-org%3AADE-Scheduler+-repo%3Aploum%2Flingi2401+&type=pullrequests), among which I am particularly proud of:

- Implementing the missing `jax.scipy.special.fresnel` function [jax#22843](https://github.com/google/jax/pull/22843);
- Adding support for all modes in `numpy.correlate` for Numba's JIT [numba#7543](https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/7543);
- Working on removing dependency to FFMPEG in Manim [manim#3501](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/3501);

I strive to make my work accessible, leveraging code quality tools, linters,
formatters, documenting my code, and so on.

You can find a few of my projects below, but feel free to go through my
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/jeertmans) for more content!
