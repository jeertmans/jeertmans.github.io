I love programming, and I love the philosophy of open sourcing content!

As a result, I am quite active on GitHub (and other platforms) on which
I publish open source contents, for my own use but also **for the community**.

I strive to make my work accessible, leveraging code quality tools, linters,
formatters, documenting my code, and so on.

You can find a few of my projects below, but feel free to go through my
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/jeertmans) for more content!
