Prior to entering my PhD, I had the chance to give practical sessions during my
3rd year of Bachelor and my Master.
It was a student job and my role was *Junior Teaching Assistants* (JTA).
A JTA is simply a *Teaching Assistant* (TA), but with less responsabilities.
Nevertheless, I enjoyed this job so much that I often participated in creating
extra educational contents for students.

As of writing, I am a TA, employed by UCLouvain,
and I am in charge of 4 courses a year, on average.
When applicable, I publish the contents I create on GitHub,
to make it reproducable, documented, and automatically tested
leveraging the power of GitHub actions.
