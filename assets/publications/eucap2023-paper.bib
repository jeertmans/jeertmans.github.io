ABSTRACT="For more than twenty years, Ray Tracing methods have continued to improve
on both accuracy and computational time aspects. However, most
state-of-the-art image-based ray tracers still rely on a description of the
environment that only contains planar surfaces. They are also limited by
the number of diffractions they can simulate. We present Min-Path-Tracing
(MPT), an alternative to the image method that can handle diffractions
seamlessly, while also leveraging the possibility to use different
geometries for surfaces or edges, such as parabolic mirrors. MPT uses
implicit representations of objects to write the path finding challenge as
a minimization problem. We further show that multiple diffractions can be
important in some situations, which MPT is capable to simulate without
increasing neither the computational nor the implementation complexity."
